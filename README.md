## Bloom & Wild frontend test

Hello! And welcome to the Bloom & Wild coding exercise. 

We recommend you spend around 3-4 hours over this exercise, but how much time you take is up to you. Read through the brief below for details of what to do and what we're looking for.

When you've finished please email sharon@bloomandwild.com and adam@bloomandwild.com and we'll arrange a time to discuss your work on the exercise. If you have any questions, just drop us an email. 

## Test brief

On our checkout we have a pricing calculator that factors in a few things:
* The bouquet being selected
* The amount of deliveries being requested
* Any extra shipping costs
* Date of delivery (not pictured below)

Please build a dynamic interface, similar to our [current checkout](https://www.bloomandwild.com/send-flowers), in Angular (and any other front end libraries or frameworks that you might find useful) that updates its pricing according to your selection.

The data needed is returned by the checkout/flowers-endpoint factory, this is a (scaled down) JSON representation of what our API actually returns, the bouquets you need to populate your checkout with are stored in the `collections[0].skus` array, inside each sku you can find pricing information in the `pricings` array (just pluck the pricing object for `quantity: 1` and use that) images are inside `default_bouquet` object.

Feel free to adjust the design, but try to make it **clean and minimal**.

We'll be looking for things like:
* A clean and simple solution
* Done in a standard way
* Good understanding of where to use libraries and where not to

Bonus points for:
* Unit tests
* Make days starting 23rd December ending 3rd January cost Â£3.50 more for the first delivery

Sample design (minus some form of date picker which is required):
